The shebang  is the #! sequence at the very beginning of a script file, followed by the path to an interpreter.
It tells the system which interpreter to use to execute the script.

Why is it needed?
When you run a script file (e.g., ./script.sh) directly as a command, the operating system looks at the shebang line to determine which interpreter should process the file.

Without the shebang:

The script won't automatically use the desired interpreter unless you explicitly specify it (e.g., bash script.sh or python script.py).
The system might fail to execute the script or use the default shell, which may not be compatible with the script.

For example:

* #!/bin/bash - Indicates the script should be run with the Bash shell.
* #!/usr/bin/python3 - Indicates the script should be executed with Python 3.
